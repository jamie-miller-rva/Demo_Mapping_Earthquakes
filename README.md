# Demo_Mapping_Earthquakes

## Basic Project Plan
Demo use of leaflet.js to create a interactive map of earthquake data from the USGS's live earthquake feed

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days using leaflet.js to create a interactive map of earthquake data from the USGS's live earthquake feed


### Tasks
* Use a URL for GeoJSON earthquake data from the USGS website and retrieve geographical coordinates and the magnitudes of earthquakes for the last seven days. 
* Add the data to a map.

### Approach
* Use the JavaScript and the D3.js library to retrieve the coordinates and magnitudes of the earthquakes from the GeoJSON data 
* Use the Leaflet library to plot the data on a Mapbox map through an API request
* Create interactivity for the earthquake data.
